5-2-2017
Added a condition back to KinematicToggle that fixed blue objects ignoring collisions
when inside of each other (was removed in the 4-28 version)

4-28-2017
Cleaned and commented most of the code

4-27-2017
Fixed lag by replacing  tables, changed KinematicToggle and SpawnObject
to be more efficient

4-24-2017
Fixed Archery Minigame bug where the Arrows wouldn't
go through the invisible walls by adding a collision
layer between the wall and arrows

4-22-2017
After demo changes - Rotated Tutorial signs to be more user friendly,
changed Tutorial so that the cube respawns. Added mesh collider to
fireplace, moved object tables closer to center of the house, cleaned
scripts up, updates Archery minigame (should allow more than one target
with any speed). Confined the area the player (and Targets) can go to
with invisible walls. Might have fixed players being able to walk
through walls.

4-21-2017
Minor demo changes - increased teleporter length and added Shethan
(created by another student).
		
4-13-2017 **Demo Ready**
Updated Tutorial and added Bow and Arrow instructions. Added Bow
spawner. Minor Archery minigame changes.

4-12-2017
Updated Archery minigame and worked on Target collision bug.
	
4-10-2017 Part2
Removed Triangle and Right Triangle objects from the game (collision
issues with other Blender object, Cone was kept as the only Blender
object). Bug with the Archery minigame where the targets would collide
with each other on spawn and move each other. Added more information in
the Tutorial.
	
4-10-2017 Part1
Fully integrated the new house with new textures and furniture into the
scene. Added a new fire with logs in the fireplace. Added new shapes
(made from Blender for the players to use: Triangle, Right Triangle and
Cone). Achery minigame changes.

4-9-2017
Large Asset cleanup. Started incorperating the new house. Tutorial added
in one of the past updates (not finished).

4-6-2017 **KinematicToggle Functionality Complete**
Fixed a bug where two objects that once had their collision ignored,
never stopped ignoring future collisions when both objects had their
Kinematic setting set to false. Solved by first ignoring a collision on
OnCollisionEnter when at least one of the two objects had its Kinematic
setting set to true. Then using OnTriggerEnter to check if the ignored
collision between the two objects needed to stop being ignored (both
objects had their Kinematic setting set to false). This required each
object prefab to have a normal box collider as well as a trigger
collider. Replaced the Terrain mountain with a mountain Skybox. Minor
Archery minigame changes.
**Removed NaturalTillingTextures asset to save space**

3-29-2017
Adjusted KinematicToggle so it changes to object's color to green when
its Kinematic setting is true (blue when Kinematic is false). Started
working on ignoring collisions between the objects if at least one of
the objects Kinematic setting is set to true (object is green). Replaced
old doors with the new Hinge Joint doors.
**Removed NaturalTillingTextures asset to save space**

3-21-2017
Minor adjustments to Archery minigame.
**Removed NaturalTillingTextures asset to save space**

3-20-2017
Started to add Archery minigame. Added Target Prefab, Target spawning
area and scripts to spawn, move, rotate and destroy the Targets.
**Removed NaturalTillingTextures asset to save space**

3-6-2017
Added Arrow Spawner and new Hinge Joint Door. Swapped the Fixed Joint
Grab Attach script the objects were using for the Track Object Grab
Attach script so that the player wouldnt drop objects on collision.
Slight Asset cleanup.
**Removed NaturalTillingTextures asset to save space**

3-3-2017 *KinematicToggle working*
Created the ShapeSpawner script that all the object tables can use to
spawn their respective shapes instead of each table having a unique
script. Solved KinematicToggle bug by changing Kinematic setting of the
object on "Ungrabbed" rather than when "Used" with the trigger. This
needed to happen because the InteractableObject script required the
Kinematic setting of the object being interacted with to be set to
false. So when the trigger is used while holding an object a kinematic
bool is inverted and on "Ungrabbed" the Kinematic setting of the used
object is set to what the kinematic bool is.
**Removed NaturalTillingTextures asset to save space**

3-2-2017
First "working" version of KinematicToggle. Would switch Kinematic
settings while being held which resulted in the controller letting go of
the object.
**Removed NaturalTillingTextures asset to save space**

2-28-2017
Created new Terrain mountains. Started working to add functionality to
KinematicToggle (not working).
**Removed NaturalTillingTextures asset to save space**

2-23-2017
Added Bow and Arrow.
**Removed NaturalTillingTextures asset to save space**

2-22-2017
Changed fire, started working on the KinematicToggle script. Started the
shape spawning scripts.
**Removed NaturalTillingTextures asset to save space**

2-21-2017
Added fire Particle System that destroys Interactable Objects on
collision.
**Removed NaturalTillingTextures asset to save space**

2-19-2017 Part2
Minor Terrain moutain changes.
**Removed NaturalTillingTextures asset to save space**

2-19-2017 Part1
Created new Terrain mountains. Added doors that open when using the
trigger on them. Resized some of the shapes.
**Removed NaturalTillingTextures asset to save space**

2-16-2017
Creared Terrain mountains with trees. Added some textures to the house.
Made the shapes interactable. Camera Rig sized to play area space.

Initial Project
Basic scene set up with VRTK asset added. Camera Rig and template house
implemented with object mountains. Shapes have no functionality.
