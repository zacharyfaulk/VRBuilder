VRBuilder is a virtual reality game, built with the VRTK asset, that lets the user build,
create and interact with 3D objects in a 3D scene. The user will use a 
Virtual Reality headset and controllers to interact with the virtual scene and partake 
in the activities the application has to offer. The game is not traditional in that it doesn't 
have any sort of scoring system or end goal for the user to accomplish. Rather 
than focusing on scoring points from performing certain tasks, the game is 
intended to focus on allowing the player to channel their creativity and build 
something from their imagination using the given materials.

Completed objectives:
•	Create a 3D environment that allows the player to feel immersed. 
•	Design enough gameplay content to allow the player to feel satisfaction despite there being no scoring system. 
•	Implement some form of tutorial for the player to get used to the controls. 
•	Design a scene inside of a small house that the player can use as the main building area.
	This area will contain all the building blocks that the player will interact with to build their creations. 
•	Use the VRTK scripts provided to implement user interaction with the building blocks using the HTC Vive controllers. 
•	Implement the VRTK teleport script to allow the player to move around the scene. 
•	Create a new script that will allow the player to turn off physics (the isKinematic property on an object's RigidBody) 
	for the held object by pulling the trigger on one of the controllers. 
•	Create some sort of visual indicator when physics is turned off for an object. 
•	Modify the Kinematic script in order to manipulate how the objects handle collisions. An object with physics turned 
	off should not collide with other objects.
•	Create a script that will allow the user to destroy any unwanted objects. 
•	Create a script that will spawn new shapes once the original is removed in order to allow the player to continue building. 
•	Design an area outside of the main house so the player doesn't feel trapped in one area. 
•	Implement a skybox that will add to the realism of the scene and increase immersion for the player.
